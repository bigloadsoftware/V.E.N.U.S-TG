  - balance: Bimbos no longer suffer lethal oxygen damage, instead they need to catch
      their breath.

  - rscadd: Adds Bimbo Vulnerability. Bimbos now take stamina damage when penetrated,
      resulting in them being pinned to the floor. Bimbos can now form complex sentences
      for a better roleplay experience and will no longer emote spam (because it annoys
      people).
